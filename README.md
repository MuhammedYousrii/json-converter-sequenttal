# JsonConverterSequenttal

## Objective:
Utilize and contribute to multiple architectural patterns while maintaining different programming paradigms, balancing complexity where necessary and simplifying where possible to demonstrate expertise across various methodologies.

### Folder Structure:
- **Features Folder:**
  - **Access**: *Core Folder, Shared Folder*
  - Description: Contains features **closely tied to business requirements** for the project.

- **Core Folder:**
  - **Access**: *Shared Folder*
  - Description: Houses **cross-cutting** concerns and essential functionalities required to bootstrap and operate the application.

- **Shared Folders:**
  - Description: Contains Angular entities that are inherently reusable and agnostic of their surrounding contexts.


This folder structure allows for a clear separation of concerns, enabling modular development and reusability of components.







## Project Architecture Overview

### Modular Design with Nx Console

Our project follows a modular design approach, where each set of related Angular entities serving a specific domain is included in one folder. We leverage Nx Console to enhance modularity by creating libraries and decomposing our app into small, manageable packages.

### Smart-Dumb Components Pattern

To ensure a clear separation of concerns and maintainability, we adhere to the Smart-Dumb Components pattern. Our components are categorized into two types:

- **Smart Components (Pages):** These components handle data fetching, state management, and business logic. They orchestrate the presentation of Dumb Components.
  
- **Dumb Components (Shared):** These reusable components focus solely on presentation logic and receive data via inputs.

### Separation of Concerns

We maintain a clear separation of concerns by assigning specific responsibilities to components and services:

- **Components:** Components are responsible for handling user interactions and orchestrating the presentation of Dumb Components. They delegate heavy calculations and data management tasks to services.
  
- **Services:** Services encapsulate heavy calculations, data manipulation, and interaction with external resources. They ensure that components remain focused on user interactions.

### Leveraging Reactive Programming with RxJS

We embrace a mixed programming paradigm, leveraging reactive programming with RxJS Observable, subjects, and operators:

- **Observables:** We use Observables to represent stores and manage asynchronous data streams. This enables us to handle complex data flows and maintain a responsive user interface.
  
- **Operators:** RxJS operators are used to transform, filter, and combine Observables, allowing us to control the flow of data in our application efficiently.
