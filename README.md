# JsonConverterSequenttal

## Objective

I seized this task as an opportunity to leverage my expertise and contribute my knowledge by adeptly utilizing and enhancing multiple architectural patterns while navigating diverse programming paradigms. Balancing complexity where warranted and simplifying where viable, I aim to demonstrate proficiency and flexibility across various approaches to solve an issue.

## Architecture Overview

In this detailed architecture overview, my primary focus was on establishing a flexible framework characterized by modularity and clear separation of concerns. Here's a breakdown of the key principles:

1. **Modularization**: This involves grouping related business logic into cohesive modules or packages, enhancing organization and scalability. By structuring code in this manner, we ensure easier maintenance and extensibility over time.

2. **Componentization**: We differentiate between presentational components, responsible for UI rendering, and logical components, which handle business operations. This distinction improves code readability and facilitates easier debugging and future development.

3. **Communication Channels**: Smart components effectively communicate with external entities like services, enabling seamless integration of functionalities. This ensures a cohesive user experience and promotes code reusability.

4. **Service Layer**: Services play a crucial role in managing the application state and executing complex computations. They offer clear, intuitive APIs, abstracting away complexity and promoting code modularity and maintainability.

5. **Routing Mechanism**: The routing system serves as the backbone of the application, allowing for dynamic feature activation and deactivation through configuration. This flexibility enhances adaptability and ensures the application can evolve to meet changing requirements.




## Folder Structure

### Features Folder:
- **Description**: Includes modules or packages representing business features, tightly coupled with specific business requirements and needs.
- **Can Access**: Core Folder, Shared Folder

### Core Folder:
- **Description**: Includes modules or packages representing cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, essential for app bootstrapping and required for seamless operation.
- **Can Access**: Shared Folder

### Shared Folder:
- **Description**: Includes Angular entities or functionalities agnostic by nature, not dependent on surrounding context.
- **Can Access**: None

### Config Folder (not yet applied):
- **Description**: Contains repetitive static configurations, such as repetitive static values or configurations required for service initialization.
- **Can Access**: None


This folder structure allows for a clear separation of concerns, enabling modular development and reusability of components.





### Modular Design with Nx Console

Task follows a modular design approach, where each set of related Angular entities serving a specific domain is included in one folder. I leverage Nx Console to enhance modularity by creating libraries and decomposing the task into small, manageable packages.


### Separation of Concerns

We maintain a clear separation of concerns by assigning specific responsibilities to components and services:

- **Components:** Components are responsible for handling user interactions and orchestrating the presentation of Dumb Components. They delegate heavy calculations and data management tasks to services.
  
- **Services:** Services encapsulate heavy calculations, data manipulation, and interaction with external resources. They ensure that components remain focused on user interactions.

### Leveraging Reactive Programming with RxJS

I embrace a mixed programming paradigm, leveraging reactive programming with RxJS Observable, subjects, and operators to control the data stream and use instructed imperative to drive the data stream



## fulfilled Flows

- A user open app and try to login
  - The user doesn't have an account 
    - register
  - The user has an account
    - login the user
    - navigate the to home page
  - The User Entered Valid Json
    - Create Data Table
  - The User Entered Invalid Json
    - Show Validation Error
  - The User search the table
    - the table got updated according
  - The user filter the table
    - The table got updated according
  - The user try to logout
    - Logout user
